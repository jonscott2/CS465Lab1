Comments: This assignment was enjoyable, but it took significantly more time than I anticipated. The website I chose was miniclip.com, which was an old Java game website. The website, as it existed then, does not
exist anymore, so I rebuilt it based on an old photograph I found. I struggled to find the correct assets when building miniclip.com because the original is no longer available. GitHub Copilot was instrumental in 
helping arrange the grids for each icon. The website does not match exactly, but I got close, considering I used only a photo and had none of their assets. If I were to do this project again, I would spend more 
time getting some of the little features to work properly instead of forcing them with unadaptable CSS. I really liked this project, and the time I spent on it didn't feel like schoolwork, but more like playing 
around.
